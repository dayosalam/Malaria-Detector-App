## Malaria Parasite Detection

This is a flask app which predicts whether the given image(blood sample) contains a malaria parasite or not. I have used the concept of transfer learning in this project. I used the pre-trained [VGG-16 model architecture](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/) which was trained with ImageNet dataset. I trained this model (by freezing the in-between convolutional layers having previously trained weights) on [Cat-vs-Dog dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) from Kaggle competition. I am able to achieve around 92% accuracy on the validation dataset.
