## Malaria Detector

This is a flask app which predicts whether the given image belongs to blood affected with malaria. I have used the concept of transfer learning in this project. I used the pre-trained [VGG-16 model architecture](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/) which was trained with ImageNet dataset.. I am able to achieve around 92% accuracy on the validation dataset.
